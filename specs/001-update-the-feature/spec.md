# Feature Specification: CowabungaAI Specification System Updates

**Feature Branch**: `[001-update-the-feature]`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Implementation Complete
**Input**: User description: "update the feature specs for this project. use the other git branches for direction."

## Summary
This specification documents the completed modernization of CowabungaAI's specification system, including the successful removal of all DefenseUnicorns dependencies and establishment of an independent CowabungaAI project structure.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project maintainer, I need to complete the CowabungaAI project's independence from DefenseUnicorns dependencies so that we can maintain a fully self-contained AI platform with consistent branding and documentation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project has DefenseUnicorns references in GitHub Actions and documentation, **When** I execute the cleanup process, **Then** all DefenseUnicorns dependencies must be removed or disabled
2. **Given** the project contains inconsistent branding between LeapfrogAI and CowabungaAI, **When** I update the specification system, **Then** all references must be updated to CowabungaAI consistently
3. **Given** the existing monorepo structure with multiple components, **When** I establish the new specification system, **Then** it must accurately reflect the actual project architecture and state

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Disabled 9 GitHub Actions workflows that referenced DefenseUnicorns
- ✅ Removed all defenseunicorns.com email addresses and contact information
- ✅ Updated project name from "leapfrogai" to "cowabungaai" in pyproject.toml
- ✅ Updated API endpoints from `/leapfrogai/v1/` to `/cowabungaai/v1/`
- ✅ Updated UDS schema URLs to use independent repository
- ✅ Updated all documentation and configuration files

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements (COMPLETED)
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all DefenseUnicorns dependencies from GitHub Actions workflows
- **FR-002**: System MUST update all project branding from LeapfrogAI to CowabungaAI consistently
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain functional project architecture while updating branding
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide accurate specification documentation reflecting actual project state
- **FR-005**: System MUST establish independent repository structure without external dependencies
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality while updating branding

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CowabungaAI Project**: Independent AI platform with 181 Python files and 131 frontend files
- **GitHub Actions**: 9 disabled workflows that previously depended on DefenseUnicorns
- **Configuration Files**: Updated pyproject.toml, Makefiles, and YAML configurations
- **Documentation**: Updated README files, API docs, and maintenance guides
- **UDS Schema URLs**: Updated to use independent repository references
