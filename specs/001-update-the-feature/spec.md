# Feature Specification: Feature Specification System Modernization

**Feature Branch**: `[001-update-the-feature]`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update the feature specs for this project. use the other git branches for direction."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project maintainer, I need to update and standardize the feature specification system for the CowabungaAI project so that we can maintain consistency across our growing codebase and ensure all features are properly documented before implementation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project has multiple feature branches with inconsistent documentation, **When** I analyze the existing branches, **Then** I must be able to identify patterns and create a standardized specification template
2. **Given** a new feature request, **When** I use the specification system, **Then** I must be able to generate a complete, testable specification document
3. **Given** existing feature branches like API endpoints, UI components, and architecture decisions, **When** I review their commit history, **Then** I must extract best practices to inform the specification template

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing branches have no documentation?
- How does the system handle features that span multiple components (API, UI, backend)?
- What if the feature specification reveals gaps in current architecture?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze existing git branches to extract feature patterns and documentation approaches
- **FR-002**: System MUST create a standardized specification template based on analysis of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific branches to prioritize - API, UI, ADR, or all?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST support automated generation of specifications from user descriptions
- **FR-004**: System MUST include validation for completeness and testability of requirements
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing feature documentation
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear guidelines for different types of features (API, UI, architecture, migrations)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature Specification**: Document that defines user requirements, acceptance criteria, and testing scenarios
- **Branch Pattern**: Observable structure and documentation approach in existing feature branches
- **Template**: Standardized format for creating new feature specifications
- **Validation Rules**: Criteria for ensuring specification completeness and quality

## Analysis from Existing Branches

### Branch Categories Identified:
1. **API Features**: Token counting endpoints, annotation details, model backend loading
2. **UI/UX Features**: Assistant management, form testing, sidebar fixes, avatar handling
3. **Architecture**: ADR documentation, model directory, testing strategy
4. **Infrastructure**: GPU resource allocation, build support for Mac Silicon, dependency management
5. **Migrations**: Database migrations, Supabase updates

### Documentation Patterns Observed:
- ADRs follow structured templates with Status/Context/Decision/Rationale
- Feature branches use conventional commit messages
- Some features lack comprehensive specification documentation
- Testing and evaluation frameworks have detailed specifications

### Recommended Improvements:
1. Standardize feature specification creation process
2. Ensure all feature branches have corresponding specifications
3. Integrate specification validation into development workflow
4. Maintain consistent documentation across different feature types
