# Tasks: Feature Specification System Modernization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-update-the-feature/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.11+, Git, PyYAML, Click, Jinja2 tech stack
   → Single project structure with src/, tests/ at repository root
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: FeatureSpecification, BranchPattern, Template, ValidationResult, Configuration entities
   → contracts/api.yaml: Complete REST API with 5 main endpoints
   → research.md: Branch patterns analysis, automation requirements
   → quickstart.md: CLI tool workflows, template system, integration patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Python project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests for all API endpoints, integration tests for CLI workflows
   → Core: models for all entities, services, CLI commands, API endpoints
   → Integration: Git integration, validation framework, template engine
   → Polish: unit tests, performance testing, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing any functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- Prioritize HuggingFace bug fix resolution (addressed in branch analysis service)
- Air-gapped deployment capability must be maintained throughout
- Template system should support all 5 feature types: API, UI, Architecture, Infrastructure, Migration

## Critical Path
1. Setup (T001-T004) → enables all development
2. Contract Tests (T005-T009) → defines API requirements
3. Models (T015-T021) → data structure foundation
4. Services (T022-T026) → business logic layer
5. CLI & API (T027-T038) → user interfaces
6. Integration (T039-T052) → system components working together
7. Polish (T053-T060) → quality and documentation

## Task Generation Validation
✅ All contracts have corresponding tests
✅ All entities have model tasks
✅ All tests come before implementation
✅ Parallel tasks are truly independent
✅ Each task specifies exact file path
✅ No task modifies same file as another [P] task
✅ HuggingFace bug analysis included in branch analysis service
✅ Air-gapped deployment requirements addressed
✅ Template system supports all feature types
