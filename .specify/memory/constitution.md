# CowabungaAI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST follow industry best practices for the AI platform domain. Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns. Documentation MUST be comprehensive and up-to-date. All components MUST implement proper error handling, logging, and monitoring.

### II. Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) MUST be followed for all new features. All code MUST have comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests. Performance testing MUST be conducted for all AI model backends. Security testing MUST be performed regularly.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All components MUST provide consistent user interfaces and experiences. The API MUST maintain OpenAI compatibility for seamless integration. All user-facing components MUST follow established design patterns and accessibility standards. Error messages MUST be clear and actionable.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All AI backends MUST meet strict performance benchmarks for response times and resource utilization. The platform MUST be optimized for resource-constrained environments. Scalability MUST be built into all components. Memory usage and CPU utilization MUST be monitored and optimized.

## Security and Compliance

### I. Data Independence
All user data MUST remain within the deployment environment. No data MUST be sent to external third-party services without explicit user consent. Encryption MUST be implemented for all data at rest and in transit.

### II. Air-Gapped Deployment
The platform MUST be deployable in air-gapped environments. All dependencies MUST be available for local deployment. Offline functionality MUST be supported where applicable.

### III. Compliance Standards
All components MUST comply with relevant security standards and regulations. Regular security audits MUST be conducted. Vulnerability scanning MUST be part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Technical Standards

### I. Architecture
Microservices architecture MUST be followed for scalability. Each backend MUST be independently deployable and testable. Standard communication protocols (gRPC, REST) MUST be used.

### II. Technology Stack
Python 3.11+ MUST be used for all backend services. FastAPI MUST be used for REST APIs. gRPC MUST be used for backend communication. Containerization MUST be implemented using Docker.

### III. Monitoring and Observability
Structured logging MUST be implemented across all components. Performance metrics MUST be collected and monitored. Health checks MUST be implemented for all services.

## Development Workflow

### I. Development Process
All features MUST follow the specification-driven development process. Code reviews MUST be conducted for all changes. Automated testing MUST pass before merging. Documentation MUST be updated with all changes.

### II. Quality Gates
All code MUST pass static analysis and linting. Security scanning MUST pass for all changes. Performance benchmarks MUST be met. Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds.

### III. Release Management
Semantic versioning MUST be followed. Breaking changes MUST be properly documented. Backward compatibility MUST be maintained where possible. Migration paths MUST be provided for breaking changes.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All team members MUST comply with these principles. Amendments MUST be proposed, reviewed, and approved through the established governance process. Regular reviews MUST be conducted to ensure continued relevance.
